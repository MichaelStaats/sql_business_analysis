# Case study - Expansion potential for high-tech products in the Brazilian market
## Introduction
In a fictional case study, we, students of the Data Science & AI course at WBS Coding School, examined the chances of success for a European high-tech online-reseller on the Brazilian market with the help of a national e-commerce platform
## Challenges
The aim of this study was to examine the national environment in terms of market growth in online retail for tech products and infrastructure for the delivery of online orders and to review the extracted data set provided by a potential national e-commerce partner with regard to the pro´s and con´s of a cooperation.
## Languages and Libraries Used
SQL, Tableau
## Key Learnings
We primarily learned how to ask solution-oriented questions, which comparisons are relevant in relation to this expansion, and how these questions and comparisons can be coded with SQL and then visually represented in Tableau.
## Challenges Overcame
In small groups, we first created an agenda for a presentation that included relevant comparisons for a possible engagement.
Then we began our research using the given data set from the potential e-commerce partner and also from external sources on the internet. 
Finally we created SQL queries for the results, exported them as CSV files, and visualised them in Tableau -> see also the attached PDF
## Additional Reflections
It was very exciting to see how the groups, in terms of goal-oriented results, never lost focus on the overall outcome and worked together quickly and cooperatively.
